About
====-=-=---- - -
-This is a simple raster image editor for 1:1 PNG files. Only 8 basic colors are supported, with no alpha channel.
-It was supposed to be a little tool to make simple pixel art and to learn python. It is my first python program.
-You may need to edit the code if you want to change some stuff like the colors or the window's size.
